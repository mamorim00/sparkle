# üîí Security Quick Reference Checklist

## üö® CRITICAL - Deploy Updated Firestore Rules NOW!

The Firestore rules have been updated to allow public read access to bookings (needed for availability checking).

### Deploy Secure Rules Immediately:

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/amorimm1/Documents/random/sparkle/sparkleapp/sparkle

# 2. Login to Firebase (if not already)
firebase login

# 3. Deploy the new secure rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# 4. Verify deployment
# Go to: Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Rules
# You should see the new rules with isSignedIn(), isOwner(), etc.
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úî  firestore: released rules firestore.rules to cloud.firestore
‚úî  Deploy complete!
```

## ‚úÖ Environment Variables Security

### Local Development (.env.local)
- [x] File exists: `.env.local`
- [x] Listed in `.gitignore`
- [x] Not committed to Git
- [x] Contains all required variables
- [ ] **ACTION:** Never commit this file!

### Production (Vercel)
- [ ] **TODO:** Set environment variables in Vercel Dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to: Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- [ ] Add these secrets:
  ```
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
  FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=xxx
  FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=xxx
  ```
- [ ] Click "Save" and redeploy

## üîê Admin Access Setup

### Add Your Admin UID

1. **Get your Firebase Auth UID:**
   - Create an account in your app
   - Go to: Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Users
   - Copy your UID (looks like: `AbCdEf123456...`)

2. **Update Firestore rules:**
   - Open: `firestore.rules`
   - Find the `isAdmin()` function (line 21)
   - Add your UID:
   ```javascript
   function isAdmin() {
     return isSignedIn() && request.auth.uid in [
       'YOUR_UID_HERE',  // ‚Üê Replace with your actual UID
     ];
   }
   ```

3. **Deploy updated rules:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

## üß™ Test Your Security

### Test Firestore Rules

```bash
# Option 1: Manual testing
# - Try accessing data while logged out (should fail)
# - Try modifying another user's data (should fail)
# - Try reading your own data (should succeed)

# Option 2: Firebase Emulator (advanced)
firebase emulators:start --only firestore
```

### Test Stripe Webhook

```bash
# Local testing with Stripe CLI
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Make a test booking and verify:
# 1. Webhook receives event
# 2. Signature is verified
# 3. Booking is created in Firestore
```

## üìã Security Audit Checklist

Run this checklist every month:

### Code Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
  ```bash
  git grep -E "(sk_live|sk_test|whsec_)" -- "*.ts" "*.tsx" "*.js"
  ```
- [ ] No private keys in Git history
  ```bash
  git log -S "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY"
  ```
- [ ] `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
  ```bash
  cat .gitignore | grep ".env"
  ```

### Firebase Security
- [ ] Firestore rules deployed
- [ ] No `allow read, write: if true;` rules
- [ ] Admin UIDs are correct
- [ ] Service account key is secure

### Stripe Security
- [ ] Webhook signature verification enabled
- [ ] Using `sk_live_` in production
- [ ] Webhook secret is unique per environment
- [ ] 2FA enabled on Stripe account

### Vercel Security
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] No secrets in build logs
- [ ] 2FA enabled on account
- [ ] Deployment protection enabled

   - Redeploy application

4. **Remove from Git:**
   ```bash
   # If you committed secrets, remove from history
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env.local" \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
