## 🔴 CRITICAL Missing Features (Must Have)

### 1. **Booking Management** ✅ COMPLETED!

**Customer Side - DONE**:
- ✅ User booking list works (queries bookings collection by userId)
- ✅ Booking details page with full information
- ✅ Cancellation functionality with refund calculation
- ✅ Rescheduling option with validation
- ✅ Booking status tracking (confirmed, cancelled, completed)

**Cleaner Side - DONE**:
- ✅ Cleaner bookings list with tabs (upcoming, completed, cancelled)
- ✅ Upcoming jobs view with "Today's Job" highlighting
- ✅ Completed jobs history
- ✅ Earnings summary (per booking + totals)
- ✅ Customer contact info with email/call buttons

**Implemented**:
```typescript
// ✅ src/app/user/bookings/page.tsx - Working
// ✅ src/app/cleaner/bookings/page.tsx - Working
// ✅ src/app/booking/[bookingId]/page.tsx - Working
// ✅ src/app/booking/[bookingId]/reschedule/page.tsx - Working
// ✅ src/app/api/bookings/cancel/route.ts - Working
```

### 2. **Notifications System** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Currently**: Only review emails exist

**Missing**:
- ❌ Booking confirmation emails (customer + cleaner)
- ❌ Reminder emails (24h before service)
- ❌ Booking cancellation notifications
- ❌ Cleaner approval/rejection emails
- ❌ Payment receipt emails

**What needs to be built**:
```typescript
// functions/src/index.ts - Add triggers
export const onBookingCreated = functions.firestore
  .onDocumentCreated("bookings/{bookingId}", async (event) => {
    // Send confirmation emails to customer and cleaner
  });

export const sendBookingReminders = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('every day 10:00')
  .onRun(async () => {
    // Find bookings 24h from now, send reminders
  });
```

### 3. **Stripe Webhook Integration** ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Currently**: Bookings created on success page (client-side) + webhook endpoint exists

**Status**:
- ✅ Webhook endpoint created (`/api/webhooks/stripe`)
- ✅ Signature verification
- ✅ Handles `checkout.session.completed` event
- ⚠️ Success page also creates booking (redundancy for reliability)
- ⚠️ Success page uses real-time listener to wait for webhook

**Still Missing**:
- ❌ Full deduplication logic
- ❌ `charge.refunded` handler (for manual refunds)
- ❌ `payment_intent.payment_failed` handler
- ❌ Webhook testing with Stripe CLI
- ❌ Production webhook URL configuration in Stripe dashboard

**Recommendation**: Test webhook reliability and potentially remove client-side booking creation

### 4. **Booking Cancellation & Refunds** ✅ COMPLETED!

**Implemented**:
- ✅ Cancellation policy defined (100% >24h, 50% <24h)
- ✅ Cancellation request flow with confirmation
- ✅ Automatic refund calculation based on hours until service
- ✅ Stripe refund integration (refunds.create)
- ✅ Booking status update to "cancelled"
- ✅ Refund tracking (refundAmount, refundStatus, refundId)

**Built**:
```typescript
// ✅ src/app/api/bookings/cancel/route.ts - Working
// Calculates refund, processes Stripe refund, updates Firestore
// Handles edge cases (past bookings, already cancelled)
```

**Still Missing**:
- ❌ Email notifications to customer and cleaner
- ❌ Cleaner availability recalculation trigger

### 5. **Search & Discovery Improvements**

**Current**: Basic location + service filtering

**Missing**:
