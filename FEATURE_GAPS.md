## 🔴 CRITICAL Missing Features (Must Have)

### 1. **Booking Management** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Customer Side - Missing**:
- ❌ User booking list is broken (queries wrong collection)
  - Currently: Queries `users.reservations` array
  - Should: Query `bookings` collection by `userId`
- ❌ No booking details page
- ❌ No cancellation functionality
- ❌ No rescheduling option
- ❌ No booking status tracking

**Cleaner Side - Missing**:
- ❌ No cleaner bookings list (critical!)
- ❌ No upcoming jobs view
- ❌ No completed jobs history
- ❌ No earnings summary
- ❌ No ability to mark job as complete

**What needs to be built**:
```typescript
// src/app/user/bookings/page.tsx - Fix query
const bookings = await getDocs(
  query(collection(db, "bookings"),
  where("userId", "==", currentUser.uid),
  orderBy("date", "desc"))
);

// src/app/cleaner/bookings/page.tsx - NEW
// Show upcoming and past bookings for cleaner

// src/app/booking/[bookingId]/page.tsx - NEW
// Booking details with cancel/reschedule options
```

### 2. **Notifications System** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Currently**: Only review emails exist

**Missing**:
- ❌ Booking confirmation emails (customer + cleaner)
- ❌ Reminder emails (24h before service)
- ❌ Booking cancellation notifications
- ❌ Cleaner approval/rejection emails
- ❌ Payment receipt emails

**What needs to be built**:
```typescript
// functions/src/index.ts - Add triggers
export const onBookingCreated = functions.firestore
  .onDocumentCreated("bookings/{bookingId}", async (event) => {
    // Send confirmation emails to customer and cleaner
  });

export const sendBookingReminders = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('every day 10:00')
  .onRun(async () => {
    // Find bookings 24h from now, send reminders
  });
```

### 3. **Stripe Webhook Integration** ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Currently**: Bookings created on success page (client-side)

**Problem**:
- ❌ If user closes browser before success page loads, booking is lost
- ❌ No handling of payment failures after redirect
- ❌ No refund handling

**What needs to be built**:
```typescript
// src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts - NEW
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const sig = req.headers.get('stripe-signature');
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, sig, webhookSecret);

  switch (event.type) {
    case 'checkout.session.completed':
      // Create booking in Firestore (move from SuccessClient)
    case 'charge.refunded':
      // Handle refund, update booking status
    case 'payment_intent.payment_failed':
      // Handle payment failures
  }
}
```

### 4. **Booking Cancellation & Refunds** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Missing**:
- ❌ Cancellation policy definition
- ❌ Cancellation request flow
- ❌ Automatic refund calculation
- ❌ Stripe refund integration
- ❌ Cleaner compensation for last-minute cancellations

**What needs to be built**:
```typescript
// src/app/api/cancel-booking/route.ts - NEW
// Calculate refund based on cancellation policy
// Issue Stripe refund
// Update booking status
// Notify cleaner
// Update cleaner availability
```

### 5. **Search & Discovery Improvements**

**Current**: Basic location + service filtering

**Missing**:
- ❌ Price range filter
- ❌ Rating filter (4+ stars, 5 stars)
- ❌ Date/time availability search ("available tomorrow at 2pm")
- ❌ Sorting options (price, rating, next available)
- ❌ Cleaner profile pages with full details

### 6. **Messaging System** (Optional but valuable)

**Missing**:
- ❌ Customer <-> Cleaner chat
- ❌ Pre-booking questions
